### Scraping and Comparing IMDb Top 250 Movies (2004 vs Now)

This project analyzes how the IMDb Top 250 movies list has changed between 2004 and now by scraping data from both the archived and current IMDb websites using Python. It compares which films have remained on the list over time, calculates rating differences, and visualizes trends through various plots.
